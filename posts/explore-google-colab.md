## About this task

- 

❓Why using Google CoLab?

- `hardware`: M1/2 GPU in Apple Silicon, AMD architecture → not compatible with CUDA (computing platform), which is only available on NVIDIA hardwares
- `computational view`: DL faster on GPU than CPU. We need CUDA for the Pytorch computation.
- `CoLab` = Google docs + free GPU
