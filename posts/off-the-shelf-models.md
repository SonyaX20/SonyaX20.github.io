## Practical Example

Hereâ€™s how you can use an off-the-shelf ResNet-50 model for an image classification task:
``` python
import torch
from torchvision import models, transforms
from PIL import Image

# Load a pre-trained ResNet-50 model
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

# Prepare the input image
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])

image = Image.open("example_image.jpg")
input_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)

# Perform inference
output = model(input_tensor)
_, predicted_class = output.max(1)

print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class.item()}")
```

## Conclusion

Off-the-shelf models represent a cornerstone in modern computer vision development. Their availability, performance, and adaptability make them invaluable tools for both research and production applications. Whether you're building a prototype or deploying a large-scale system, these pre-trained models offer a powerful foundation for your computer vision projects.
